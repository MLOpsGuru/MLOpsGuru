# 👋 Hi, I'm Mariusz

🚀 **Engineer on a mission to operationalize machine learning at scale**  
🧠 Turning models into monitored, versioned, and production-ready systems

---

## 🔧 About Me

I'm an infrastructure-focused engineer building intelligent, automated pipelines for modern machine learning. My goal is to bridge the gap between notebooks and production — making models not only work, but work reliably in real environments.

### 🔍 Specialties:
- **CI/CD for ML** using GitHub Actions, Docker, and Kubernetes
- **MLOps Systems** with MLflow, monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana), and model drift detection
- **DevOps Practices** with Terraform, AWS, and automation-first principles
- **End-to-End Platforms** that track data, model, metrics, and deployment

## 📦 Featured Projects

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🧠 `daily-retraining-pipeline` | ML system that retrains a model daily with CI/CD + Kubernetes deployment |
| 🚨 `shadow-drift-detector` | Shadow model deployment with Prometheus-based drift alerts |
| ⚙️ `devops-aws-infra` | Terraform + AWS + GitHub Actions for scalable infra setup |
